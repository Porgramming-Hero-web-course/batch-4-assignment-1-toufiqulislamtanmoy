## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union and intersection types are essential tools for creating expressive and safe types in TypeScript. They allow us to define more flexible and powerful types that enhance code quality and maintainability. By utilizing these tools, we can write more robust and reliable code, ensuring that your TypeScript applications are well-typed and easy to understand.

### Union Types
A union type represents a value that can be one of several types. It's like an "or" operation, where a variable can hold a value that satisfies any one of the types in the union.
* **Syntax:**  `type MyType = string | number | boolean;` 
* **Significance:**
    * **Flexibility:**  Allows variables to hold values of different types, making your code more adaptable.
    * **Type Checking:**  Provides type safety, ensuring that operations performed on a variable are valid for any of the possible types in the union.
    * **Clearer Intent:**  Communicates the expected range of values to other developers, enhancing code clarity.

### Intersection Types
Definition: An intersection type combines multiple types into a single type. It's like an "and" operation, where a variable must satisfy all types in the intersection.
* **Syntax:**  `type MyType = string & number;` (Though this is practically unusable, as no value can be both a string and a number at the same time).
* **Significance:**
    * **Stricter Typing:** Enforces that a value must satisfy multiple type requirements, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
    * **Data Enrichment:**  Allows for the creation of more complex types by merging properties from different sources.
    * **Improved Reusability:**  Reusable types can be created by intersecting multiple existing types, facilitating code organization and maintenance.

**Examples:**

**Union Type:**

```typescript
function greet(name: string | number) {
  if (typeof name === 'string') {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello, user ${name}!`);
  }
}

greet("Alice"); // OK
greet(123); // OK
greet(true); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'. 
```

**Intersection Type:**

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface Admin {
  role: "admin";
}

type SuperUser = User & Admin;

const superUser: SuperUser = {
  name: "Bob",
  role: "admin" 
};
```
